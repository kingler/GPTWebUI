# Web UI for GPT
This project is a web user interface for a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT). It fetches messages from a server, parses them, and displays them on the web page.
## Files
- `index.html`: This is the main structure of the web page.
- `index_dark.html`: This is the structure of a dark-themed version of the web page.
- `index_pastel.html`: This is the structure of a pastel-themed version of the web page.
- `script.js`: This provides the functionality for the web page.
## Dependencies
The project depends on the Tailwind CSS framework, which is included from a CDN.
